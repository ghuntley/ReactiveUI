ReacitveUI is a [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel)
framework that allows you to the [Reactive Extensions](https://rx.codeplex.com/)
for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or
desktop platform. Supports Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac, WPF, 
Windows Forms, Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store apps.


Multi-threaded UI development typically has one sticking point; it's easy
enough to define a lambda or function and set it up to run on a separate
thread but one has to be very careful when moving the result of that lambda
back onto the UI thread to display it. Reactive Extension's secret sauce is
to simplify this dangerous activity and deliver a true 'fire-and-forget'
multi-thread solution.
